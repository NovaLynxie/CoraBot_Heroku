# About Cora
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I am NovaLynxie's personal discord bot built using discord.js on nodejs.
 A while back, I was made as a small test bot to help run experimental features and help them as a discord bot for their guild.
 Now, I am much more stable compared to my early days of running experimental code and testing the limits of what I could achieve.
 My main purpose is to help you bring some life to your discord guild or community server, wherever I can.
 I can play some music for you, give you information about me or help you moderate your own guild using my own custom built admin commands!
 Don't worry, I also come with a help command so you can find out what commands I have, just ask whenever you're having trouble remembering one of my commands.
